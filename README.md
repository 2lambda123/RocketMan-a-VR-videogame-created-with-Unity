The escape-room videogame **Rocket Man**, realized for **Oculus Quest** (1 and 2), takes you into an
apocalyptic world. The goal is to escape the earth thanks to a rocket that you will first need to repair
and set up through various riddles. You can move by walking, teleporting, or by using the joystick of the
controllers. To solve the riddles, you have to use various tools that you can pick up using your hands or
through magnetic grabbing.

The game was realized in the frame of the course [CS-444 Virtual Reality](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/virtual-reality-CS-444) and it was awarded as the **best game of the course** for year 2021/2022. 


## Game Trailer
The GIF and video that follow contain some gameplay scenes that might represent a **spoiler** of the solution of some riddles in the game. Be aware of this before watching them, if you want to play the game. Since GitHub doesn't let upload videos bigger than 10Mb, the video had to be compressed and the quality is much lower than the original :(.
